# Performance Modeling Abstractions Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Document 9: Performance Modeling Abstractions for Simulation Speedup & Test Case Design.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Model Parameters Enhancement
- Added `aggregated_ops` section to all models in `configs/model_params.json`
- Each model now has pre-calculated aggregated statistics for:
  - Prefill operations (total FLOPs and memory per prompt token)
  - Decode operations (total FLOPs and memory per token in batch)

### 2. Performance Abstraction Utilities
- Created `src/llmperforacle/utils/performance_abstractions.py` with:
  - `CollectiveCommunicationModels`: Analytical models for collective operations
    - Ring AllReduce
    - AllGather
    - ReduceScatter
  - `MacroOperations`: Aggregated computation calculators
    - Macro prefill operations
    - Macro decode operations
    - Pipeline parallel stage operations

### 3. Level of Detail (LoD) Configuration
- Added `lod` parameter to simulation configuration
  - `"high"`: Detailed per-layer simulation (default)
  - `"medium"`: Aggregated macro operations and analytical collectives
- Modified `SimulationEnvironment` to track and provide LoD setting
- Updated `ExperimentOrchestrator` to pass LoD to frameworks

### 4. Framework Modifications

#### AbstractLLMFramework
- Added LoD awareness to base class
- Modified `_estimate_prefill_ops` and `_estimate_decode_op` to use macro operations when LoD is "medium"

#### VLLMFramework
- Modified `_execute_tp_prefill` to use single aggregated operation instead of per-layer operations when LoD is "medium"
- Modified `_execute_tp_decode` similarly
- Updated `_simulate_tp_collective` to use analytical models instead of detailed network transfers when LoD is "medium"

### 5. Test Infrastructure
- Created test configurations for three scenarios:
  - Single GPU (focus on macro operations)
  - Tensor Parallelism with 4 GPUs (focus on analytical collectives)
  - Combined TP+PP with 8 GPUs (both optimizations)
- Implemented comprehensive performance comparison test suite
- Added unit tests for all abstraction utilities

## Performance Benefits

The implementation achieves simulation speedup through:

1. **Reduced Event Count**: 
   - High LoD: O(num_layers) events per prefill/decode
   - Medium LoD: O(1) events per prefill/decode

2. **Simplified Collectives**:
   - High LoD: Multiple network transfer events per collective
   - Medium LoD: Single timeout event based on analytical model

3. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Fewer SimPy event objects
   - Reduced Python overhead

## Trade-offs

- **Speed**: Medium LoD provides significant speedup for large-scale simulations
- **Fidelity**: Some accuracy loss in modeling fine-grained resource contention
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between detail levels via configuration

## Usage

To use the performance abstractions:

```yaml
simulation:
  max_simulation_time: 600
  lod: "medium"  # Enable performance abstractions
```

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_performance_abstractions.py -v
```

Run integration tests:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_lod_simple_demo.py -v
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Additional collective operations (Broadcast, Scatter, Gather)
2. More sophisticated analytical models (e.g., LogGP model)
3. Adaptive LoD based on simulation scale
4. Profiling-guided abstraction selection
