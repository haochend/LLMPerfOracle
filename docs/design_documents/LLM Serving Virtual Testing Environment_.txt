A Virtualized Environment for Comparative Performance Analysis of Large Language Model Serving Frameworks
I. Executive Summary
The rapid proliferation and increasing complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred significant innovation in serving frameworks designed to deploy these models efficiently and cost-effectively. However, evaluating and comparing the performance of these diverse frameworks (e.g., TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang, Dynama, Triton Inference Server) under realistic conditions presents a considerable challenge. Direct benchmarking on physical hardware is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and often difficult to replicate across different environments. This report outlines the technical design for a virtual, hardware-agnostic simulation environment aimed at addressing these challenges.
The proposed simulator is architected with modularity, extensibility, and agnosticism towards specific LLM serving frameworks and underlying hardware as core tenets. It leverages a discrete-event simulation (DES) engine to orchestrate the complex interactions within an LLM serving scenario. This foundation is augmented by detailed, configurable models for generating realistic user workloads, emulating the operational behavior of various LLM serving frameworks, and representing the performance characteristics of abstract virtual hardware profiles.
Key capabilities of this simulation environment include the generation of diverse LLM serving workloads that mirror patterns observed in production systems, including bursty arrival rates and heterogeneous token length distributions. It will allow for the modeling of a wide array of LLM serving strategies, such as different batching algorithms (e.g., continuous, dynamic), sophisticated Key-Value (KV) cache management techniques (e.g., PagedAttention, RadixAttention), advanced scheduling policies, and disaggregated serving architectures. Consequently, the simulator will enable comprehensive comparative analyses based on critical performance indicators such as Time To First Token (TTFT), Time Per Output Token (TPOT), end-to-end request latency, system throughput, and simulated hardware utilization metrics. These comparisons can be conducted across various serving frameworks and under different virtual hardware configurations without requiring access to physical infrastructure.
The deployment and utilization of this simulator are expected to yield a more nuanced understanding of the performance trade-offs inherent in different LLM serving solutions. It will provide a cost-effective platform for exploring the performance envelope under diverse operational conditions, thereby accelerating the development, optimization, and strategic deployment of efficient and scalable LLM serving infrastructure. This tool is intended for ML engineers, MLOps professionals, and researchers focused on LLM infrastructure and performance.
II. Foundations: Simulating LLM Serving Dynamics
To construct a virtual testing environment capable of meaningful performance comparisons, it is imperative to first establish a robust understanding of the dynamics of LLM serving and the metrics by which performance is assessed. This section lays the groundwork by characterizing realistic LLM workloads and defining the key performance indicators that the simulator must capture.
A. Characterizing LLM Serving Workloads for Realistic Simulation
The performance of LLM serving systems is not an intrinsic constant but is profoundly influenced by the characteristics of the incoming request workloads.1 Using overly simplistic or unrepresentative workloads can lead to misleading benchmark results and, subsequently, to suboptimal design and deployment decisions for LLM serving infrastructure. For instance, benchmarks that do not account for the typical burstiness of real-world traffic or the variability in prompt and generation lengths may not accurately predict performance under operational conditions.2 The primary goal of the simulator's workload generation module is, therefore, to produce request streams that faithfully replicate the complex dynamics observed in production LLM usage. This involves modeling several key aspects of user behavior and request characteristics, informed by recent studies of large-scale LLM serving traces such as those presented in the ServeGen 1 and BurstGPT 3 initiatives.
* Request Arrival Patterns & Inter-Arrival Times (IAT):
Production LLM workloads typically exhibit bursty arrival patterns, where periods of high request intensity are interspersed with lulls, rather than conforming to simple, memoryless Poisson distributions.1 The analysis presented in the ServeGen study suggests that distributions like Gamma and Weibull often provide a more accurate statistical fit for the inter-arrival times (IATs) observed in real-world services.1 For example, the Gamma distribution, characterized by its shape (k or α) and scale (θ or β) parameters, can model a wide range of arrival processes, from near-exponential to more peaked distributions, reflecting varying degrees of burstiness.7 Similarly, the Weibull distribution, with its shape and scale parameters, is also adept at capturing such variable arrival patterns.11 The BurstGPT dataset further corroborates the presence of diverse concurrency patterns, noting that burstiness can vary significantly depending on the specific service (e.g., API vs. conversational) and the type of LLM being served.3
The accurate modeling of these non-uniform arrival patterns is critical because burstiness directly impacts system behavior, leading to queue buildup, increased resource contention, and variable effectiveness of different batching and scheduling strategies employed by LLM serving frameworks. A simulator must be able to generate these complex arrival sequences to rigorously test the responsiveness and stability of the frameworks under evaluation.
* Tokenomics: Input/Output Length Distributions & Prompt Complexity:
The number of input tokens (prompt length) and output tokens (generation length) in LLM requests are highly variable and often demonstrate a weak correlation.1 This unpredictability in token lengths has significant implications for resource allocation and performance.
The ServeGen methodology proposes modeling input lengths using a mixture of Pareto and Log-normal distributions, and output lengths with Exponential distributions.6 The Pareto distribution can capture heavy-tailed phenomena where a small number of requests might have very long prompts, while the Log-normal can model more centrally-tending prompt lengths. An Exponential distribution for output lengths suggests that shorter responses are more common, with the probability of very long responses decaying exponentially. Tools like scipy.stats in Python can be utilized for sampling from such distributions.17 Empirical data from the BurstGPT traces also provide valuable insights into these distributions in real-world scenarios.3
The number of input tokens primarily dictates the computational load of the prefill stage, while the number of output tokens determines the duration and memory footprint (particularly for the KV cache) of the iterative decode stage. Consequently, an accurate representation of these token length distributions is fundamental for the simulator to realistically estimate resource consumption, processing times, and the effectiveness of memory management strategies within different serving frameworks.
* Client Behavior Heterogeneity & Per-Client Modeling:
A significant finding from the ServeGen study is that aggregate workload characteristics are often disproportionately shaped by a small cohort of "top clients" who exhibit distinct and sometimes highly variable behavior patterns. In contrast, the majority of individual clients might display more stable and predictable usage.1 Fluctuations in the activity of these top clients can cause noticeable shifts in the overall workload's statistical properties, such as burstiness or average token lengths.
This observation strongly suggests that a per-client modeling approach is necessary for the simulator's workload generation module. Relying solely on aggregate statistical distributions for the entire workload would obscure the impact of these dominant, heterogeneous clients. Such an aggregated model would fail to generate specific, challenging scenarios—for example, a sudden burst of long-prompt requests from a single, high-RPS client—that are crucial for testing the adaptability, fairness, and robustness of the dynamic scheduling and resource management mechanisms within LLM serving frameworks. To achieve high fidelity, the simulator must therefore support the definition and composition of multiple, distinct client profiles, each characterized by its own set of stochastic parameters for arrival rates and request characteristics.
* Conversational Context, Prefix Caching, and Multi-Turn Interactions:
Many contemporary LLM applications, such as chatbots and virtual agents, involve multi-turn conversations where the context from previous interactions is essential for generating coherent and relevant subsequent responses.1 This conversational context is typically maintained in the serving system's Key-Value (KV) cache. Efficient reuse of this cached context, particularly through techniques like prefix caching (where the KV cache for common leading sequences of tokens is reused), can lead to substantial improvements in latency, especially for Time To First Token (TTFT).16 LLM inference servers like vLLM implement "automatic prefix caching" to leverage this.16
To accurately model this, the ServeGen framework proposes "conversation-aware mocking," a technique to preserve the integrity of conversational histories when generating synthetic workloads.6 The BurstGPT dataset also provides analyses of conversation patterns observed in production.4
The simulator must therefore be capable of generating sequences of correlated requests that represent ongoing conversations. This involves not only generating individual requests with appropriate token lengths but also associating them with a persistent conversational state. This state information is crucial for the simulator's KV cache models to determine potential prefix cache hits, which directly influences the simulated duration of the prefill phase and, consequently, the TTFT for follow-up requests in a dialogue. Without this, the performance benefits of frameworks optimized for conversational AI (e.g., vLLM 16, SGLang with RadixAttention 22) would be underestimated.
* Modeling Prefill vs. Decode Phase Dynamics:
LLM inference fundamentally comprises two distinct computational phases:
   1. Prefill Phase: This initial phase processes all tokens in the input prompt concurrently. It involves significant computation, often dominated by large matrix-matrix multiplications, to generate the attention keys and values (KV cache) for the entire prompt and to produce the very first output token. This phase is generally considered compute-bound.16
   2. Decode Phase: Following the prefill, this phase generates subsequent output tokens one by one, in an autoregressive manner. Each decoding step uses the KV cache accumulated from all previous tokens (prompt + already generated tokens) to predict the next token. This phase is characterized by many smaller computations (often matrix-vector operations) and substantial memory traffic due to repeated access to the (potentially large and growing) KV cache, making it primarily memory-bandwidth-bound.16 These two phases have different resource utilization profiles and performance bottlenecks. This distinction has driven the development of advanced serving architectures like disaggregated serving, where prefill and decode operations might be handled by separate, specialized hardware units to optimize resource allocation and overall system efficiency.16 The simulator must meticulously model the resource demands (virtual compute units, virtual memory bandwidth) and the corresponding execution times for these two phases independently for every request. This detailed modeling is crucial for accurately evaluating the performance of various batching strategies (which might combine prefill and decode operations from different requests into a single batch, e.g., hybrid batching 25) and for assessing the efficacy of architectures like disaggregated serving.
B. Defining Performance: Key Metrics for LLM Serving Simulation
To enable meaningful comparisons between different LLM serving frameworks, the simulator must track and report a comprehensive set of performance metrics. These metrics should cover user-perceived latency, system throughput, and the efficiency of virtual resource utilization.
   * Core Latency Metrics: These quantify the responsiveness of the LLM serving system from the end-user's perspective.
   * Time To First Token (TTFT): This is the duration from the moment a user submits a prompt until the first token of the LLM's response is received by the user (or simulated as such). TTFT is a critical metric for interactive applications like chatbots, as it directly impacts the user's perception of system responsiveness.23 The computational work of the prefill phase is the primary determinant of TTFT.23
   * Time Per Output Token (TPOT) / Inter-Token Latency (ITL): After the first token is generated, TPOT measures the average time taken to produce each subsequent output token. It reflects the "streaming speed" or fluency of the model's response as it's being generated.16 A lower TPOT generally leads to a smoother and faster-perceived generation process.
   * End-to-End Latency (Total Generation Time): This is the total time elapsed from the submission of a request until the entire response has been generated (e.g., an end-of-sequence token is produced or a maximum length is reached). It can be calculated using TTFT and TPOT: Latency=TTFT+(TPOT×(num_output_tokens−1)) (assuming TPOT is for tokens after the first) or similar formulations.23 The simulator must diligently record the timestamps for these events for every processed request. Aggregate statistics such as mean, median, and various percentiles (e.g., P50, P90, P95, P99) for these latency metrics are essential outputs for comparative analysis.
   * Throughput Metrics: These metrics quantify the overall processing capacity of the simulated LLM serving system under a given workload and virtual hardware configuration.
   * Requests Per Second (RPS) / Queries Per Second (QPS): This is the rate at which the system successfully completes the processing of user requests. While intuitive, its value can be influenced by the average length of the generated responses; systems processing many short responses might show higher RPS than those processing fewer, longer responses, even with similar token processing capabilities.34
   * Output Tokens Per Second (TPS): This measures the total number of output tokens generated by the system across all concurrent users and requests per unit of time. TPS is often considered a more robust and definitive measure of a serving system's raw processing power as it normalizes for variations in response lengths.23 The simulator should report both peak and average throughput values over the simulation period to provide a comprehensive view of system capacity.
   * Virtual Hardware Utilization Metrics: As the simulator operates without actual hardware, direct measurement of physical utilization (e.g., GPU SM busy percentage) is not possible. Instead, the simulator will track proxy metrics that indicate how efficiently the modeled LLM serving framework utilizes the provisioned virtual hardware resources.
   * Simulated Model Bandwidth Utilization (MBU-sim): Drawing inspiration from the MBU metric used for real hardware analysis 23, MBU-sim can be defined as: MBUsim​=Peak Simulated Memory Bandwidth of Virtual HardwareAchieved Simulated Memory Bandwidth​ The Achieved Simulated Memory Bandwidth for a decode step of a request can be estimated from: Simulated TPOT for that tokenSize of Model Parameters for one layer+Size of KV Cache accessed for one token​ This metric provides a normalized way to compare how effectively different frameworks make use of the simulated memory bandwidth defined in the virtual hardware profile, particularly during the memory-intensive decode phase.
   * Virtual Compute Utilization Factor: This can be estimated by accumulating the total theoretical Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) processed by all simulated LLM operations (derived from the cost models in Section IV.D) over a defined time window, and comparing this to the peak theoretical FLOPs capability of the virtual hardware for that same window (i.e., vGPU_Compute_FLOPs × time_window_duration). A higher ratio would suggest more effective use of the provisioned virtual compute capacity, especially during prefill.
   * KV Cache Usage Statistics: The simulator must maintain detailed statistics regarding the (simulated) KV cache, which is a critical resource in LLM serving:
   * Total simulated memory (e.g., in GB or number of blocks) allocated to KV cache over time.
   * Number of active KV cache blocks or pages, particularly relevant for systems like vLLM employing PagedAttention.35
   * Frequency and volume of KV cache evictions or swaps to CPU/disk (if modeled).
   * Prefix cache hit rate: For conversational workloads, this measures how often the beginning of a new prompt matches a sequence already in the KV cache, allowing reuse.16 These simulated utilization metrics are vital for diagnosing why one framework might exhibit better latency or throughput than another within the virtual environment. For example, a framework achieving a lower TPOT might correlate with a higher MBU-sim, indicating more efficient interaction with the simulated memory subsystem. Similarly, high KV cache eviction rates could explain increased latencies due to the need for recomputation.
   * Queueing Statistics: The underlying Discrete Event Simulation engine (e.g., SimPy) will naturally facilitate the collection of queueing statistics for requests at various stages within the simulated serving pipeline.
   * Average and maximum queue lengths for requests awaiting batching and subsequent processing.
   * Average and maximum waiting times experienced by requests in these queues.
   * Number of preemptions, if the modeled serving framework employs preemptive scheduling policies. These statistics are essential for identifying potential bottlenecks within the simulated system, understanding its stability under varying load conditions, and evaluating the fairness and efficiency of different scheduling algorithms implemented by the LLM framework adapters.
The interplay between latency and throughput is a fundamental characteristic of serving systems. Optimizations aimed at maximizing throughput, such as forming larger batches of requests or employing aggressive request packing, often lead to an increase in per-request latency.23 Conversely, strategies prioritizing minimal latency, like processing requests in very small batches or even individually, can result in underutilization of (virtual) hardware resources and consequently lower overall system throughput. Different LLM serving frameworks and their configurable policies (e.g., the MAX_UTILIZATION versus GUARANTEED_NO_EVICT policies in TensorRT-LLM 41) represent distinct choices along this latency-throughput trade-off spectrum. The simulator, by meticulously measuring these metrics across a range of frameworks, virtual hardware profiles, and workload intensities, will enable users to visualize and quantify these trade-offs. This, in turn, allows for informed decisions in selecting a serving strategy that best aligns with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as prioritizing low latency for interactive chatbot applications or maximizing throughput for offline batch processing tasks.23
In a hardware-agnostic simulation environment, where direct measurement of physical hardware costs is absent, the simulated utilization metrics (MBU-sim, Virtual Compute Utilization Factor) serve as crucial proxies for inferring potential cost-efficiency. In real-world deployments, achieving higher utilization of expensive GPU resources generally translates to a better return on investment and lower operational costs.23 Therefore, a framework that consistently demonstrates higher simulated utilization for a given workload and virtual hardware profile can be inferred as potentially more cost-efficient if deployed on comparable real hardware.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of KV cache management, particularly prefix caching in conversational AI scenarios, directly impacts TTFT and overall system efficiency.16 A higher prefix cache hit rate, as tracked by the simulator, will translate directly into shorter simulated prefill phases for conversational turns, thus reflecting lower TTFTs and better resource usage. This capability is essential for comparing frameworks that offer specialized optimizations for such interaction patterns, like SGLang's RadixAttention 22 or vLLM's automatic prefix caching.16
III. Survey of Enabling Technologies for Virtual LLM Testing
The development of the proposed LLM serving simulator will not occur in a vacuum. It can draw upon a rich ecosystem of existing simulation frameworks, specialized LLM inference simulators, and workload generation tools. This section reviews key enabling technologies that can provide foundational components, architectural inspiration, or methodologies for the simulator's design.
A. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Frameworks as a Core Engine
Discrete Event Simulation is a modeling paradigm where the state of a system changes only at discrete points in time, triggered by the occurrence of specific "events." This approach is highly suitable for simulating systems like LLM serving environments, which involve sequences of operations such as request arrivals, queueing for resources, processing, and service completions.1
   * SimPy (Python-based DES framework):
SimPy stands out as a strong candidate for the core simulation engine due to its Pythonic nature, process-oriented modeling capabilities, and robust support for shared resources.46
      * Event Scheduling: SimPy manages an event queue, typically implemented as a heap, processing events in chronological order. For events scheduled at the exact same simulation time, a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) order is maintained by using a strictly increasing event ID as a tie-breaker.52 This mechanism is well-suited for orchestrating the sequence of operations in an LLM serving pipeline, from request arrival to token generation and final completion.
      * Resource Modeling: A key strength of SimPy is its flexible resource modeling.
      * Resource, PriorityResource, and PreemptiveResource types can effectively model contention for virtual compute units, such as abstract GPU cores available for prefill or decode tasks. These resources have a defined capacity, and processes (requests) queue if the resource is fully utilized.53 For example, a PreemptiveResource could model a scenario where high-priority inference tasks can interrupt lower-priority ones.
      * Container resources can model consumable or rate-limited entities like virtual memory bandwidth or the total capacity of the KV cache. Processes would get() a certain amount of bandwidth or KV cache blocks and put() them back, with queueing if the resource is depleted.53
      * Data Collection: SimPy facilitates the collection of simulation data, such as queue lengths, waiting times, and resource utilization statistics, either through direct data appending within process functions or by using monitoring hooks and callbacks.54 The Python-centric nature of SimPy aligns well with the broader machine learning and LLM ecosystem, which is predominantly Python-based (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch). This synergy can simplify the integration of workload generation components or framework-specific logic if parts of these are also developed in Python. While SimPy excels at modeling system-level dynamics, resource contention, and queuing behavior 47, it does not inherently simulate the fine-grained execution time of a specific LLM operation on a particular hardware architecture. This implies that SimPy is best utilized as the overarching simulation framework that manages the flow of requests and contention for abstract resources. The actual "service time" or duration for an LLM operation (like a prefill or decode step) will be determined by a separate "virtual hardware modeler" module, which SimPy processes will query.
      * Other DES Tools:
      * DE-Sim: This is another Python-based, object-oriented DES tool, noted for its capabilities in complex, data-driven modeling.1 While SimPy appears more directly suited for the process and resource modeling needed here, DE-Sim's features could offer complementary ideas, especially if future extensions require intricate handling of large datasets within the simulation logic.
      * CloudSim: A Java-based framework, CloudSim is extensively used for simulating cloud computing environments, including IaaS and PaaS scenarios.66 It offers detailed modeling of datacenters, hosts, VMs, and network topologies. The recently re-engineered CloudSim 7G, with its standardized Java interfaces and modular design 69, provides valuable architectural principles regarding modularity and extensibility. However, for a hardware-agnostic LLM serving simulator where the primary focus is on framework logic rather than detailed cloud infrastructure, SimPy's agility and Python integration might be more advantageous. The Java environment of CloudSim could introduce additional complexity if other components of the LLM simulation ecosystem are Python-based.
B. Specialized Simulators for LLM Inference
Recent research has produced simulators specifically targeting LLM inference, offering valuable insights and architectural precedents.
      * TokenSim (Key Reference Design):
TokenSim is a prominent example of a DES framework tailored for LLM inference, built using SimPy. It is designed for comprehensive hardware and software co-exploration.24
         * Architecture: TokenSim employs a modular architecture. It uses SimPy for the event-driven simulation core and integrates with external "compute simulators" (e.g., GenZ, LLMCompass, or Roofline-based models) to estimate the execution time of LLM operations on different hardware configurations.75 This separation of concerns—SimPy handling system dynamics and resource contention, while specialized modules estimate operation costs—is a validated approach that the proposed simulator can adopt.
         * Modeling Capabilities: It features a detailed transformer-oriented simulation model, distinguishing between the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode stages.24 TokenSim supports user-definable scheduling policies (via global and local schedulers) and memory management strategies. Notably, it can simulate advanced techniques like disaggregated prefill and decode architectures.24
         * Hardware and Workload: TokenSim accepts dynamic LLM request inputs sampled from real datasets like ShareGPT and allows configuration of diverse hardware components, including GPUs, CPUs, PIMs, memory characteristics (capacity, bandwidth), and network interconnects.24
         * Accuracy: TokenSim has been validated against real systems (vLLM, DistServe), demonstrating high accuracy with error rates typically below 1% for throughput and low errors for latency percentiles.24 Its finer-grained memory simulation (block-granularity) is cited as a reason for higher accuracy compared to some other simulators, particularly for dynamic workloads.24 TokenSim provides a strong architectural template, especially its use of SimPy, its approach to abstracting hardware performance via pluggable compute simulators, its detailed modeling of LLM-specific operations, and its focus on extensibility for new optimizations like disaggregation. A key distinction for the proposed simulator is its primary aim for hardware agnosticism through parametric cost models rather than reliance on potentially complex, cycle-accurate external hardware simulators.
         * Vidur and INFERMAX:
Vidur is another LLM inference simulator, against which TokenSim has been compared.24 INFERMAX is an analytical framework built upon Vidur, designed for the cost-effective development and analysis of LLM inference schedulers.26
INFERMAX employs cost models to predict batch execution times based on the number of tokens to be processed and the KV cache data to be read.80 It breaks down batch execution time into costs for non-attention operations, decode-phase attention, and prefill-phase attention, considering factors like token counts and KV cache interactions. This cost modeling approach is highly relevant for the proposed simulator's virtual hardware module, offering a methodology for estimating task durations without detailed hardware simulation. INFERMAX also uniquely formulates the optimal scheduling problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) to establish theoretical performance bounds.80
The success of TokenSim, particularly its high accuracy achieved by combining SimPy for system dynamics with specialized modules for operator cost estimation, strongly supports the viability of a modular, multi-level simulation strategy. The proposed simulator can adopt a similar philosophy: SimPy will manage the "when" and "who" (request scheduling, resource allocation decisions), while a custom "virtual hardware performance modeler" will determine the "how long" (operator execution time based on parametric models).
Furthermore, the LLM serving landscape is characterized by rapid innovation (e.g., disaggregated serving 16, novel attention mechanisms 22). TokenSim's ability to model new techniques like disaggregation by allowing user-defined schedulers and operator-level hooks 24 underscores a critical design principle: the simulator must be inherently extensible to remain relevant and useful for evaluating emerging serving strategies. The emphasis on accurate memory modeling in TokenSim 24 and the memory-bound nature of LLM decoding 23 also highlight that the proposed simulator must incorporate a robust model of virtual memory capacity, bandwidth, and the interaction of various KV cache strategies (like PagedAttention) with these virtual resources.
C. Generating Realistic Input: LLM Workload Generators & Datasets
The fidelity of the simulation heavily depends on the realism of the input workload. Several recent efforts provide methodologies and data for generating such workloads.
            * ServeGen:
ServeGen offers a principled framework for characterizing production LLM workloads and generating synthetic workloads that mirror these characteristics.1
               * Methodology: It emphasizes a per-client composition approach, recognizing that overall workload patterns are often driven by the heterogeneous behaviors of individual clients.1
               * Key Features: ServeGen models IATs using distributions like Gamma or Weibull, input token lengths with a mixture of Pareto and Log-normal distributions, and output token lengths with Exponential distributions. It also incorporates "conversation-aware mocking" to preserve the context of multi-turn interactions.6 The framework is intended to be open-sourced.85 ServeGen provides the most advanced, data-backed methodology for generating the request stream and its statistical properties, forming a strong foundation for the simulator's workload generation module.
               * BurstGPT & BurstGPT-Perf:
BurstGPT provides a publicly available, large-scale real-world LLM serving workload trace dataset, collected from Azure OpenAI GPT services. This dataset details request concurrency, request/response token lengths, service types (API vs. conversational), LLM types, and failure instances.3
                  * Trace Schema: The BurstGPT trace typically includes fields such as Timestamp (request submission time), Model (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4), Request tokens, Response tokens, Total tokens, and Log Type (Conversation log or API log).4
                  * Benchmark Suite (BurstGPT-Perf): Associated with the dataset is BurstGPT-Perf, a benchmark suite designed to scale the characteristics of BurstGPT traces for evaluating system performance. Its workload generator includes components like a Prompt Sampler, a Prompt Pool (to provide actual prompt texts or their characteristics), a Concurrency Generator (to time requests based on patterns), and an HTTP client for interacting with serving engines.3 BurstGPT offers invaluable real-world trace data that can be used to parameterize the statistical distributions in the simulator's workload generator, validate the generated synthetic workloads, or even be replayed (after appropriate scaling and adaptation) directly within the simulation. The design of BurstGPT-Perf's components, such as the Prompt Pool and Concurrency Generator, offers practical implementation ideas.
                  * Offline Datasets for Prompts (e.g., CNNDailyMail):
Datasets like CNNDailyMail are used in some LLM batch inference examples for tasks such as summarization.94 While the proposed simulator primarily focuses on serving dynamics rather than NLP task performance, having a mechanism to associate requests with abstract prompt characteristics (e.g., "summarization task," "code generation task") or even sample from a pool of representative prompt lengths/types (akin to BurstGPT-Perf's Prompt Pool 4) could be beneficial for more advanced modeling in the future, especially if certain prompt types correlate with different generation complexities or resource demands.
The combination of ServeGen's statistical modeling methodology and per-client composition approach with the empirical data and patterns from BurstGPT traces offers a powerful and robust strategy for the simulator's workload generation module. ServeGen provides the "how-to" for generating new, scalable workloads with realistic distributions, while BurstGPT offers concrete data for parameterization, validation, or direct (scaled) replay.
Moreover, the emphasis on "conversation-aware mocking" in ServeGen 6 and the analysis of conversation patterns in BurstGPT 4 are critical. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in interactive, multi-turn applications like chatbots and agents 16, simulating sequences of related requests—rather than just independent, stateless ones—is essential for accurately modeling KV cache behavior, prefix caching benefits, and thereby, the true performance of frameworks in such scenarios. The "Prompt Pool" concept from BurstGPT-Perf 4 is also valuable. It allows the simulator to decouple the generation of request characteristics (arrival time, input/output lengths, conversational linkage) from the need to generate or store actual prompt content, keeping the simulation focused on serving dynamics while still allowing for future extensions where prompt type might influence simulated processing costs.
IV. Technical Design: A Modular and Agnostic LLM Serving Simulator
The proposed LLM serving simulator will be architected as a collection of interacting modules, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the simulation. This modular design, centered around a discrete-event simulation core, is key to achieving the desired framework-agnosticism and extensibility.
A. Core Simulator Architecture
The simulator's architecture is designed to provide a flexible and extensible platform for evaluating LLM serving frameworks without reliance on physical hardware.
                     * Event-Driven Engine (SimPy-based):
The simulation will be orchestrated by a central SimPy Environment.47 This environment manages the simulation clock and the scheduling of events.
                        * Processes: Key entities within the simulation, such as incoming user requests, virtual instances of LLM serving frameworks (referred to as "virtual workers"), and potentially components like load balancers, will be modeled as SimPy Process objects. These processes will yield events to the environment, representing the passage of time for operations or waiting for resources.
                        * Event Scheduling: SimPy's event scheduling mechanism, which uses a heap-based event queue and processes events in chronological order (with FIFO for simultaneous events), will manage the timeline of all simulated activities: request arrivals, batch formation, prefill and decode steps, token generation, and request completions.52
                        * Key Modules (High-Level Overview):
The simulator will comprise several interconnected modules:
                           1. Workload Generation Module: Responsible for creating a stream of LLM requests based on configurable parameters, statistical distributions, and client behavior models, drawing from principles established by ServeGen and BurstGPT.
                           2. Request Dispatcher & Global Scheduler Module: This module (optional for single-instance simulations but crucial for multi-instance or disaggregated setups) decides which virtual LLM framework instance should handle an incoming request. It may implement various load balancing or routing strategies.
                           3. Pluggable Virtual LLM Framework Instance Module: This is the core representation of an LLM serving framework (e.g., a virtual vLLM server or a TRT-LLM engine). It encapsulates the framework-specific logic for request handling, batching, KV cache management, and internal scheduling. This module will be designed with a common interface to allow different framework "adapters" to be plugged in.
                           4. Abstract Virtual Hardware Modeler Module: This module simulates the performance characteristics of the underlying "virtual hardware" on which the LLM framework instance is notionally running. It does not simulate hardware at a cycle-accurate level but rather uses parametric cost models to determine how long various LLM operations (prefill, decode, etc.) would take given a specific virtual hardware profile.
                           5. Performance Monitoring & Logging Module: Collects, aggregates, and logs all relevant performance metrics (latency, throughput, queue statistics, virtual utilization) for post-simulation analysis.

	                           * Interaction Flow (Simplified Example):
                           1. The Workload Generation Module creates a request object (containing attributes like arrival time, input token sequence characteristics, expected output token characteristics, client ID, conversation ID, etc.) and schedules its arrival as a SimPy event.
                           2. At the simulated arrival time, the request event triggers. If a Request Dispatcher is active, it evaluates the request and the state of available Virtual LLM Framework Instances and assigns the request to one of them.
                           3. The assigned Virtual LLM Framework Instance receives the request. It simulates its internal logic:
                           * It might place the request in an internal queue.
                           * Its internal scheduler periodically attempts to form a batch from waiting requests, considering its batching strategy (e.g., continuous batching, dynamic batching) and available virtual resources (e.g., KV cache capacity, maximum batch size).
                           4. Once a batch is formed for an operation (e.g., prefill for new requests in the batch, or a decode step for ongoing requests in the batch), the Framework Instance module queries the Virtual Hardware Modeler. It provides details such as the operation type (prefill, decode), the number of tokens involved, batch size, and the active virtual hardware profile.
                           5. The Virtual Hardware Modeler uses its parametric cost models to calculate an estimated execution time for this operation on this batch under the specified virtual hardware profile.
                           6. The Framework Instance then yields a SimPy timeout event for this calculated duration, effectively pausing its execution and advancing the simulation clock.
                           7. Upon timeout completion (simulating the operation finishing), the Framework Instance updates its internal state (e.g., generated tokens, KV cache usage) and schedules further actions (e.g., next decode step, processing completed requests).
                           8. Throughout this process, the Performance Monitoring & Logging Module records significant events, state changes, and metric values (e.g., request arrival, batch formation, token generation, TTFT, TPOT, queue lengths).
This modular architecture, with clear separation of concerns, is fundamental to achieving the goals of framework and hardware agnosticism. The Workload Generation module should be oblivious to the specifics of any LLM serving framework. Similarly, the Virtual LLM Framework Instance module should not need to understand the intricate details of how the virtual hardware calculates operation times; it only needs a standard way to query for these durations. Conversely, the Virtual Hardware Modeler should be independent of any specific LLM framework's internal logic, focusing only on costing the types of abstract operations (e.g., "prefill N tokens for batch size B") it is asked to evaluate. This design philosophy, drawing parallels with the interface-driven modularity seen in systems like CloudSim 7G 69, is crucial for enabling easy extension and substitution of different components in the future.
The Virtual LLM Framework Instance module represents the most intricate part of the simulator. It must effectively act as a state machine that mirrors the request processing lifecycle of a real LLM serving framework. This involves managing internal queues (such as vLLM's waiting, running, and swapped request queues 95), making scheduling and batching decisions based on simulated resource availability (which will be represented by SimPy resources modeling token limits, KV cache block limits, etc.), and simulating framework-specific optimization techniques.
B. Workload Generation Module Design
The Workload Generation Module is responsible for producing a realistic and configurable stream of LLM requests that drive the simulation. Its design will be heavily influenced by the findings and methodologies of recent workload characterization studies like ServeGen 1 and the data provided by traces like BurstGPT.3
                           * Integration of ServeGen/BurstGPT Principles:
                           * Per-Client Composition: The generator will adopt the per-client composition methodology advocated by ServeGen.1 This allows the simulation to capture the impact of heterogeneous client behaviors, where a few "top clients" might significantly influence overall workload dynamics.
                           * Client Profiles: Users will be able to define multiple "client types." Each type will be characterized by its own set of parameters governing request arrival patterns, token length distributions, and conversational behavior.
                           * Trace-Informed Parameterization: The module will be designed to utilize data from real-world traces like BurstGPT.92 This data can be used in several ways:
                           * To directly derive the parameters for the statistical distributions used by each client type (e.g., fitting a Gamma distribution to observed IATs from a segment of the BurstGPT trace).
                           * For validation, by comparing the statistical properties of the generated workload against those of the real trace.
                           * Potentially, for scaled replay of segments of a real trace, if such a mode is desired for specific validation scenarios.
                           * Parameterization and Distributions:
The module will offer configurability for the following request characteristics, often on a per-client-type basis:

*   **Prompt Characteristics (Abstract Representation):** While not generating full prompt text, the request object will carry abstract characteristics relevant for simulation. This includes:
   *   `is_continuation_of_conversation`: A boolean flag.
   *   `conversation_id`: A unique identifier for the conversation a request belongs to.
   *   `shared_prefix_length_if_cached`: If it's a continuation, this field (determined by the KV cache model of the serving framework) indicates how many leading tokens are expected to be a cache hit. This directly impacts the prefill computation.
*   **Inter-Request Dependencies (Conversations):**
   *   The module will implement a mechanism to generate sequences of requests that belong to the same conversation, following ServeGen's "conversation-aware mocking" principle.[6]
   *   Configurable parameters will include the probability of a new request being a continuation of an existing conversation and the typical number of turns in a conversation (which could also be drawn from a distribution).

                              * Output of the Module: The Workload Generation Module will produce a timed stream of SimPy events. Each event signifies the arrival of a new LLM request. The event will carry a request object containing all relevant attributes, such as:
                              * arrival_time: The simulated time at which the request enters the system.
                              * client_id: Identifier for the client (or client type) that generated the request.
                              * conversation_id: Identifier for the conversation, linking related requests.
                              * input_token_count: Number of tokens in the input prompt.
                              * max_output_token_count: The maximum number of tokens to be generated for the response (used for termination conditions).
                              * is_continuation: Boolean indicating if this is a follow-up in a conversation.
                              * Other potential metadata (e.g., request type, priority if modeled).
The use of statistical distributions for workload parameters, ideally fitted from or validated against real-world traces like BurstGPT 3, offers a more robust approach than relying on fixed or overly simplistic assumptions. This allows the simulator to generate workloads that are not only realistic for general LLM serving but also adaptable to specific application domains or user bases if custom trace data is available for parameterization.
The explicit inclusion of conversation_id and the is_continuation flag in the request objects generated by this module is crucial. These attributes are the primary link for the downstream Virtual LLM Framework Instance and its KV cache model to simulate the effects of context reuse and prefix caching.16 Without them, the simulator cannot accurately model the significant performance benefits (especially reduced TTFT) that these caching mechanisms provide in conversational AI workloads, leading to an underestimation of the efficiency of frameworks that excel in such scenarios.
C. Modeling LLM Serving Frameworks (Framework-Agnostic Interface)
A central tenet of the simulator is its ability to compare different LLM serving frameworks. This requires a design that allows various frameworks to be "plugged into" the simulation environment. This is achieved by defining a common, abstract interface for LLM serving primitives and then creating specific "adapters" for each supported framework that implement this interface.
                              * Defining a Common API for LLM Serving Primitives:
The core idea is to abstract the fundamental operations and decision points common to most LLM serving systems. The Virtual LLM Framework Instance module will interact with the rest of the simulator (e.g., the request stream, the virtual hardware modeler) through this standardized API. This API will define methods that an adapter for any specific LLM serving framework must implement.
Potential primitives in this API could include:
                                 * initialize_framework(config, virtual_hardware_profile): Sets up the framework adapter with its specific configuration (e.g., batch sizes, KV cache settings) and the virtual hardware it's running on.
                                 * submit_request(request_object): Informs the framework adapter about a new incoming request. The adapter will then manage this request according to its internal logic (e.g., add to a queue).
                                 * step_simulation(current_time): This method is called by the main simulation loop at each time step or when an event occurs. It triggers the framework adapter to perform its scheduling logic, attempt to form batches, and initiate processing.
                                 * get_pending_operations(): Called by the simulator core after step_simulation to retrieve a list of operations (e.g., "prefill batch X," "decode batch Y") that the framework wants to execute next, along with the batch details.
                                 * report_operation_completion(operation_id, completion_status): Informs the framework adapter that a previously requested operation has finished (after a simulated delay determined by the Virtual Hardware Modeler).
                                 * get_completed_requests(): Allows the simulator core to retrieve requests that have finished generation.
                                 * get_framework_stats(): Returns internal statistics from the framework adapter (e.g., queue lengths, KV cache utilization specific to its management strategy).
                                 * Pluggable Adapters for Specific Frameworks:
Each supported LLM serving framework will be represented by a Python class (an "adapter") that implements the common API defined above. This adapter will encapsulate the unique algorithms and behaviors of that framework.
                                    * TensorRT-LLM Adapter 38:
                                    * In-flight Batching (Continuous Batching): The adapter will simulate TensorRT-LLM's Batch Manager logic.103 This involves maintaining internal queues and, at each simulated iteration (driven by step_simulation), attempting to add new requests to the active batch and processing completions for requests already in flight.
                                    * Scheduling Policies: It will model distinct scheduling policies like GUARANTEED_NO_EVICT and MAX_UTILIZATION.41
                                    * GUARANTEED_NO_EVICT: Simulates reserving KV cache space for the maximum possible tokens a request might generate, ensuring no eviction once scheduled. This means checking if kvCacheManager.getRemainingBlocksToCompletion(*req) can be satisfied from available virtual blocks.41
                                    * MAX_UTILIZATION: Simulates a more aggressive packing strategy, considering only the KV cache needed for the next single step (kvCacheManager.getNeededBlocksOneStep(*req)).41 This implies modeling potential preemption if the cache becomes full, where an existing request might be paused to make space.
                                    * Paged KV Cache: The adapter will simulate the management of the KV cache in pages/blocks, including allocation and potential eviction based on the chosen policy and available virtual memory.38
                                    * Multi-GPU/Multi-Node (Conceptual): While not simulating detailed communication primitives, the adapter could account for tensor/pipeline parallelism by adjusting the cost of operations (via the Virtual Hardware Modeler) or by creating multiple interacting sub-instances if a detailed multi-vGPU simulation is undertaken.
                                    * vLLM Adapter 26:
                                    * PagedAttention for KV Cache Management: This is central to vLLM. The adapter must simulate the allocation of KV cache memory in fixed-size blocks, managing block tables (mapping logical sequence blocks to physical virtual blocks), and handling dynamic allocation/deallocation as sequences grow and shrink.35 It will also model memory sharing between sequences (e.g., for parallel sampling) via reference counting or copy-on-write semantics for these virtual blocks.36
                                    * Continuous Batching Scheduler: The adapter will implement vLLM's iteration-level scheduler logic.95 This involves:
                                    * Maintaining request queues (e.g., waiting, running, swapped states for sequence groups 95).
                                    * At each step, dynamically composing a batch of sequences for the next forward pass, adding new requests if capacity (simulated block availability) allows.
                                    * Immediately freeing resources (virtual blocks) when a sequence completes, making space available for new or swapped-in sequences in the very next iteration.
                                    * Automatic Prefix Caching: The adapter should model vLLM's capability to reuse KV cache for shared prefixes in prompts, especially for conversational requests.16 This would involve checking incoming prompts against a simulated cache of previously processed sequences.
                                    * Dynama Adapter 16:
                                    * Disaggregated Prefill and Decode: This is a key feature of Dynama. The adapter will need to simulate two distinct pools of virtual workers: prefill workers and decode workers.28
                                    * Requests would first go to a prefill worker for initial KV cache generation.
                                    * The adapter must then simulate the transfer of this KV cache (an operation with its own latency, determined by the Virtual Hardware Modeler based on vInterconnect_Bandwidth_GBps and cache size) to a decode worker.
                                    * The decode worker then handles subsequent token generation.
                                    * LLM-Aware Request Routing (KV-Aware Routing): Dynama routes queries to workers with the highest KV cache hit rate.28 The adapter will need to maintain a (simulated) state of KV cache contents or hit potential across its virtual decode workers and implement routing logic based on this.
                                    * KV Cache Offloading: Dynama can leverage multi-tier memory hierarchies.28 This can be modeled conceptually by having the Virtual Hardware Modeler return different access latencies for KV cache data depending on whether it's in "fast" (vHBM) or "slow" (vSystemMemory/vSSD) virtual tiers, with the adapter managing the simulated movement between these tiers.
                                    * SGLang Adapter 22:
                                    * RadixAttention for KV Cache Reuse: The adapter will need to simulate SGLang's RadixTree structure for storing and matching shared prefixes in the KV cache.22 This involves modeling the tree operations (insertion, lookup) and how they reduce redundant computations for requests with common prefixes.
                                    * Compressed Finite State Machines (FSMs) for Structured Decoding: For requests that require structured output (e.g., JSON), SGLang uses compressed FSMs to accelerate decoding.44 The adapter could model this by applying a speed-up factor (obtained from the Virtual Hardware Modeler) to the decode steps for such requests, or by simulating the multi-token "jump forward" capability if a more detailed model is desired.45
                                    * Scheduling and Parallelism Primitives: SGLang has its own frontend language with primitives for generation and parallelism control.44 The adapter would need to interpret these (in an abstract way) to determine how requests are batched and processed.
                                    * Triton Inference Server Adapter 119:
                                    * Multi-Framework/Backend Support (Abstract): Triton can serve models from various backends (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT-LLM, vLLM).119 The Triton adapter in the simulator could achieve this abstractly by either:
                                    * Allowing the Triton adapter to "wrap" other implemented framework adapters (e.g., a Triton instance configured to use a vLLM backend would internally use the vLLM adapter for core processing logic).
                                    * Using more generic cost models in the Virtual Hardware Modeler that represent an "average" backend if specific backend simulation is not required.
                                    * Dynamic Batching: The adapter will simulate Triton's dynamic batcher, which groups incoming requests based on parameters like max_batch_size and max_queue_delay_microseconds.119 It will model how batches are formed if preferred batch sizes are met or if the delay timeout is reached.
                                    * Sequence Batching for Stateful Models: For stateful models, the adapter will need to simulate Triton's management of sequences using correlation IDs and control signals (sequence start, end, ready) to ensure requests belonging to the same sequence are routed to the same virtual model instance.121
                                    * Concurrent Model Execution: Triton can run multiple model instances concurrently.119 The simulator can model this by allowing multiple instances of the Triton adapter (or the adapters it wraps) to run in parallel, each with its own allocated virtual resources.
The core differentiators among LLM serving frameworks often lie in their specific algorithms for request scheduling, batch formation, and KV cache management. For example, vLLM's continuous batching 111 and PagedAttention 35 offer a different approach to resource management and throughput optimization compared to TensorRT-LLM's in-flight batching and its distinct scheduling policies like MAX_UTILIZATION.41 Dynama's disaggregated architecture 28 introduces another dimension of system design. The adapters must accurately capture these unique algorithmic behaviors to enable meaningful performance comparisons.
Furthermore, simulating preemption and its associated costs is vital for evaluating advanced schedulers. Policies like TensorRT-LLM's MAX_UTILIZATION may preempt ongoing requests to maximize GPU use.41 This preemption is not without penalty; it can involve stopping a request and potentially recomputing its KV cache later (similar to the recomputation mode in vLLM 95). The simulator must model not only the decision logic for preemption but also the performance impact of such actions (e.g., the time taken for re-prefilling the KV cache for a preempted request) to accurately compare these policies against non-preemptive ones or different preemption strategies.
The adoption of a standardized adapter interface is key to the simulator's extensibility. As new LLM serving frameworks emerge, they can be incorporated into the simulation environment by developing a new adapter class that adheres to this common API, without requiring modifications to the core simulation engine or other existing adapters. This directly addresses the user's requirement for a system that can be easily extended.
D. Modeling Virtual Hardware (Hardware-Agnostic Profiles)
The simulator aims to be hardware-agnostic, meaning it does not simulate specific GPU SKUs at a cycle-accurate level. Instead, it uses "Virtual Hardware Profiles" defined by a set of key performance parameters. The Virtual Hardware Modeler module uses these profiles to estimate the execution time of LLM operations.
                                    * Defining Abstract Hardware Profiles:
Users will define virtual hardware configurations through a configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON). These profiles are not meant to be exact replicas of specific physical hardware but rather represent classes of hardware capabilities (e.g., "High-End Compute vGPU," "Memory-Bandwidth Optimized vGPU," "Entry-Level vGPU").

These parameters, inspired by real hardware specifications [129, 130, 131] and simulation needs [75], define the performance envelope of the virtual hardware.

                                       * Operator-Level Performance Cost Models:
The Virtual Hardware Modeler module takes an LLM operation (e.g., prefill a batch, decode one token for a batch), the characteristics of the batch (number of requests, token counts), and a virtual hardware profile as input. It outputs an estimated execution time for that operation.
                                          * Methodology:
                                          1. FLOPs Calculation for Compute-Bound Operations: For operations primarily limited by computation (mainly large matrix multiplications during the prefill phase), the total number of FLOPs is estimated based on the model architecture (e.g., hidden size, number of attention heads, sequence length) and the batch characteristics. The simulated time is then: Timecompute​=vGPU_compute_tflops_prefill_effectiveTotal FLOPs​ This approach is supported by analyses that break down LLM operations into FLOPs.132
                                          2. Memory Access Calculation for Memory-Bound Operations: For operations primarily limited by memory bandwidth (mainly accessing the KV cache during the decode phase, and loading model weights), the total amount of data moved (in GB) is estimated. This includes fetching relevant parts of the model weights for the current layer and reading/writing KV cache entries. The simulated time is then: Timememory​=vGPU_memory_bandwidth_gbpsTotal Bytes Moved​ This aligns with the understanding that decode is memory-bandwidth bound.23
                                          3. Roofline Model Application (Conceptual): To determine whether an operation should be costed based on FLOPs or memory bandwidth, a conceptual Roofline model approach is used.131
                                          * The arithmetic intensity (AI) of an operation is calculated as: AI=Bytes MovedFLOPs​.
                                          * The balance point (ridge point) of the virtual hardware is: AIridge​=vGPU_memory_bandwidth_gbpsvGPU_compute_tflops​.
                                          * If AIoperation​>AIridge​, the operation is considered compute-bound, and its time is estimated using the FLOPs calculation.
                                          * If AIoperation​<AIridge​, the operation is considered memory-bound, and its time is estimated using the memory access calculation.
                                          * If AIoperation​≈AIridge​, time could be max(Timecompute​,Timememory​) or a combined model. The Roofline table provided in 132 for LLaMA layers (distinguishing prefill and decode) directly informs this, classifying operations like q_proj in prefill as compute-bound and q_proj in decode as memory-bound, along with their OPs and memory access figures. This is a crucial input for how the cost model should determine the dominant factor.
                                          4. Calibration Factors and Overheads: Simple calibration factors (e.g., multipliers) or additive constants can be introduced to the cost models. These can account for aspects not captured by raw FLOPs/Bytes, such as kernel launch overheads, minor data transfers, or software stack inefficiencies. These factors could be initially estimated and later refined by comparing simulation outputs against known relative performances from a few real-world benchmarks or from the cost models developed in frameworks like INFERMAX, which are trained on profiling data.26 For instance, INFERMAX's cost models for non-attention, decode-attention, and prefill-attention (e.g., prefill attention scaling with ∑c2 and decode attention with ∑m) can be directly adapted.83
                                          * Leveraging TokenSim/INFERMAX Concepts: The design of the Virtual Hardware Modeler is analogous to the "compute simulator" abstraction in TokenSim.75 However, instead of invoking a detailed, potentially slow, external hardware simulator, our VHM uses these faster parametric cost models. The structure of cost functions in INFERMAX, which separately models non-attention, decode-attention, and prefill-attention components based on token counts and KV cache size, provides a validated mathematical basis for these parametric models.80
The accuracy of the comparative analysis produced by the simulator hinges more on the relative correctness and consistency of these cost models than on their absolute precision in matching any single real hardware. As long as the models correctly capture how different LLM operations scale with batch size, sequence length, and the defined virtual hardware parameters (FLOPs, bandwidth, capacity), the ranking of frameworks and the relative performance differences observed in simulation should provide meaningful and actionable insights. The Roofline model concept provides a vital theoretical underpinning for deciding how an operation's simulated time is calculated. For instance, if virtual memory bandwidth is doubled, the simulator should correctly predict a significant speed-up for memory-bound decode operations but a lesser impact on compute-bound prefill operations. This responsiveness to virtual hardware profile changes is key to the simulator's utility.Finally, the modeling of virtual KV cache capacity (vGPU_memory_capacity_gb) and its interaction with framework-specific management strategies (like PagedAttention 35) is inseparable from the hardware modeling. The LLM framework adapters will need to query this virtual capacity to make their batching, scheduling, and preemption decisions, creating a tight feedback loop between the simulated framework logic and the simulated hardware state.Table 4: LLM Operations and their Cost Modeling Basis

E. Ensuring Extensibility and Configurability
A primary design goal is to create a simulator that can adapt to the evolving landscape of LLM serving technologies and cater to diverse experimental needs. This necessitates a strong emphasis on extensibility and configurability.
                                          * API Design for New Components:
                                          * LLM Framework Adapters: A well-documented abstract base class (or a set of interfaces if using a language that supports them more formally, like Java, though Python is assumed here) will define the contract that any new LLM serving framework adapter must adhere to. This class will specify methods for initialization (receiving framework-specific configs and the virtual hardware profile), request submission, triggering a scheduling/processing iteration, retrieving operations to be costed by the hardware modeler, reporting operation completions, and querying internal state. This ensures that the core simulation engine can interact with any framework adapter in a standardized way.
                                          * Virtual Hardware Profiles: A structured format, such as JSON Schema or Python dataclasses, will be used to define new virtual hardware profiles. This ensures that all necessary parameters (as listed in Table 3) are provided in a consistent manner. The cost models within the Virtual Hardware Modeler will be designed to consume these parameters generically, applying them to the appropriate formulas for operation costing.
                                          * Configuration-Driven Simulation Scenarios:
To maximize flexibility and reproducibility, entire simulation scenarios will be defined through external configuration files (e.g., YAML or JSON format). These configuration files will allow users to specify:
                                             * Workload Generation Settings: Definition of client types, their respective request arrival patterns (distribution types and parameters), input/output token length distributions, conversation characteristics (turn length, probability of continuation), the mix of client types, and the total duration or number of requests for the simulation run.
                                             * Frameworks Under Test: A list of LLM framework adapters to be instantiated and evaluated in the simulation run. Each framework entry can also include framework-specific configuration parameters (e.g., vLLM's gpu_memory_utilization or TRT-LLM's batch_scheduler_policy).
                                             * Virtual Hardware Profiles: A list of virtual hardware profiles against which the selected frameworks will be tested.
                                             * Simulation Run Parameters: Global settings for the simulation run, such as the random seed (for reproducibility), logging levels, and output directories for results.
                                             * Plugin Architecture (Conceptual):
To further enhance modularity, a plugin-like system can be envisioned. New framework adapters or even alternative Virtual Hardware Modeler implementations (e.g., one using a different cost modeling approach) could be developed as separate Python packages or modules. These could then be "registered" with the core simulator, perhaps through entry points or a simple plugin discovery mechanism, allowing users to extend the simulator's capabilities without modifying its core codebase.
The use of standardized interfaces is the cornerstone of this extensibility. If the interaction points between the core simulation engine and its pluggable modules (framework adapters, hardware profiles, workload generators) are clearly defined and remain stable, new components can be developed and integrated with minimal friction and without risking the integrity of existing functionalities. This approach mirrors the successful modularity of systems like the Triton Inference Server, which supports multiple backends through a common interface.119
Configuration-driven execution is equally important. By externalizing the definition of experimental scenarios into configuration files, users can easily set up and manage complex benchmarking studies. For example, one could systematically evaluate frameworks A, B, and C, each across hardware profiles X, Y, and Z, under workload conditions W1 and W2, simply by crafting the appropriate configuration files and running them through the simulator. This facilitates reproducible research and allows for a methodical exploration of the performance landscape, directly addressing a key aspect of the user's request for a comparative testing environment.
F. Data Collection and Analysis
The ultimate value of the simulator lies in the data it produces and the insights that can be derived from it. Therefore, comprehensive data collection and robust analysis capabilities are essential.
                                                * Comprehensive Logging:
                                                * Event Logging: The simulator will log all key events with high-resolution simulated timestamps. This includes:
                                                * Request events: arrival, assignment to a framework instance, start of prefill, end of prefill (first token generated), each subsequent token generation, request completion, request preemption/resumption.
                                                * Batching events: batch formation (listing request IDs and types – prefill/decode – in batch), batch submission for processing, batch completion.
                                                * KV cache events: allocation of (virtual) blocks/pages, eviction of blocks/pages, prefix cache hit/miss indications.
                                                * Metric Logging: All defined performance metrics (TTFT, TPOT, end-to-end latency per request; aggregate throughputs like RPS and TPS; queue lengths and wait times at various points; simulated utilization metrics like MBU-sim and virtual compute utilization factor) will be logged.
                                                * Output Format: Logged data should be in a structured, machine-readable format, such as Comma-Separated Values (CSV) or Apache Parquet. This facilitates easy parsing, processing, and analysis using standard data analysis tools (e.g., Pandas in Python, R, SQL databases).
                                                * Mechanisms for Comparative Analysis:
The simulator should be accompanied by (or provide hooks for) tools and scripts to aid in the analysis of its output, particularly for comparing different framework/hardware/workload configurations.
                                                   * Result Aggregation: Scripts to parse log files from multiple simulation runs (each representing a different configuration) and aggregate key performance metrics into summary tables.
                                                   * Comparative Visualization: Tools to generate comparative plots, such as:
                                                   * Latency Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) for TTFT and end-to-end latency, allowing visual comparison of latency profiles across frameworks.
                                                   * Throughput (TPS or RPS) vs. offered load (e.g., input QPS) curves to identify saturation points and compare scalability.
                                                   * Bar charts comparing average/median/percentile latencies or throughputs for different configurations.
                                                   * Time-series plots of queue lengths or virtual resource utilization to understand system dynamics over the simulation run.
Granular logging is not just for final results; it is indispensable for debugging the simulator itself and for validating the modeling of each framework adapter. If a particular framework's simulated performance deviates from expectations, detailed logs of its internal scheduling decisions, the composition of batches it formed, and its KV cache operations (e.g., allocation successes/failures, eviction choices) are necessary to trace the behavior and pinpoint whether the discrepancy lies in the adapter's logic, its interaction with the workload, or the virtual hardware cost model.
Ultimately, the simulator's output should transcend raw numerical data to provide actionable insights. The analysis tools should empower users to answer practical questions, such as: "For my specific workload characterized by short, bursty conversational requests, which LLM serving framework offers the best P99 TTFT on a virtual hardware profile constrained by memory bandwidth?" or "How does the throughput of a disaggregated serving model (like Dynama) scale with increasing input prompt lengths compared to a co-located serving model (like vLLM) on a compute-rich virtual hardware profile?" This requires not just data, but tools for its effective comparison and interpretation.
V. Implementation Strategy and Recommendations
Developing a comprehensive LLM serving simulator as described is a significant undertaking. A phased approach, leveraging existing open-source tools and concepts where appropriate, and incorporating iterative calibration and validation, is recommended.
A. Phased Development Approach
A staged implementation allows for incremental progress, early validation of core components, and adaptation based on findings from earlier phases.
                                                   1. Phase 1: Core Simulation Engine & Basic Workload/Hardware Model:
                                                   * Objective: Establish the fundamental simulation loop and data flow.
                                                   * Tasks:
                                                   * Implement the core discrete-event simulation engine using SimPy, including the main event loop and time management.
                                                   * Develop a rudimentary Workload Generation Module: capable of generating requests with simple arrival patterns (e.g., Poisson process for IATs) and fixed or uniformly distributed input/output token lengths.
                                                   * Create a minimalistic Virtual Hardware Modeler: This version might use highly simplified cost models, such as a fixed time per prefill token and a fixed time per decode token, or a constant time per batch regardless of content, just to get the mechanics working.
                                                   * Implement a single, very basic Virtual LLM Framework Instance Adapter: This could model a simple First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduler with static batching (i.e., wait for a fixed number of requests or a timeout before processing).
                                                   * Implement basic Performance Monitoring & Logging: Capture and log fundamental metrics like request arrival/completion times, TTFT, TPOT, and overall throughput.
                                                   * Validation: Ensure the simulation runs, events are processed in order, and basic metrics are plausible.
                                                   2. Phase 2: Advanced Workload Generation & Parametric Hardware Modeling:
                                                   * Objective: Enhance the realism of inputs (workload and hardware).
                                                   * Tasks:
                                                   * Refine the Workload Generation Module to incorporate the principles from ServeGen and BurstGPT. This includes:
                                                   * Implementing support for multiple client profiles.
                                                   * Adding configurable distributions for IATs (Gamma, Weibull), input token lengths (mixture of Pareto/Log-normal), and output token lengths (Exponential).
                                                   * Implementing conversation-aware request generation (tracking conversation_id, is_continuation).
                                                   * Develop the Virtual Hardware Modeler with parametric cost models based on FLOPs/Bytes and conceptual Roofline principles, as detailed in Section IV.D. This involves creating functions that take operation type, batch characteristics, and a virtual hardware profile (Table 3) to output an estimated execution time.
                                                   * Validation: Compare the statistical properties of generated workloads against ServeGen's findings or BurstGPT traces. Validate the sensitivity of hardware cost models to changes in virtual hardware parameters (e.g., does doubling vGPU_memory_bandwidth_gbps roughly halve the time for simulated memory-bound operations?).
                                                   3. Phase 3: Sophisticated Framework Adapters for Key Systems:
                                                   * Objective: Model the core logic of prominent LLM serving frameworks.
                                                   * Tasks:
                                                   * Develop the Virtual LLM Framework Instance Adapter for vLLM. This is a high priority due to vLLM's popularity and its distinct PagedAttention and continuous batching mechanisms. This will involve simulating block-based KV cache management, internal request queues (waiting, running, swapped), and the iteration-level scheduling logic.
                                                   * Develop the adapter for TensorRT-LLM, focusing on its in-flight batching (Batch Manager) and configurable scheduling policies (GUARANTEED_NO_EVICT, MAX_UTILIZATION), including KV cache reservation and potential preemption logic.
                                                   * Validation: Log internal states and decisions of the adapters (e.g., batch composition, KV cache allocation map, preemption events) and verify they align with the documented behavior of the respective real frameworks under simplified scenarios. Compare relative performance trends (e.g., vLLM should show benefits for variable output lengths due to continuous batching).
                                                   4. Phase 4: Advanced Features, Further Frameworks, & Extensibility Refinement:
                                                   * Objective: Expand capabilities and solidify the simulator's extensibility.
                                                   * Tasks:
                                                   * Develop adapters for other frameworks like SGLang (RadixAttention, FSMs), Dynama (disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing), and Triton Inference Server (dynamic/sequence batching, multi-model). Simulating disaggregated serving will require modeling inter-worker (virtual) communication for KV cache transfer.
                                                   * Refine the common API for framework adapters based on experience gained.
                                                   * Develop more comprehensive data analysis and visualization tools for comparing multiple simulation runs.
                                                   * Implement a more formal plugin architecture for easier addition of new components.
                                                   * Validation: Test the new adapters and features against their expected behaviors. Ensure the analysis tools provide clear comparative insights.
B. Leveraging and Extending Existing Open-Source Tools
The development process should actively leverage existing open-source software and research to accelerate progress and build upon established work.
                                                   * SimPy: This will serve as the foundational discrete-event simulation library.47 Its process-based paradigm, resource modeling, and event management are directly applicable.
                                                   * TokenSim Concepts & Code (if permissible): The architectural design of TokenSim, particularly its use of SimPy for the main loop, its definition of LLM operations, and its modular approach to compute simulation, provides a strong reference.24 If its open-source license (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT) allows, and the code structure is suitable, parts of TokenSim's SimPy-based infrastructure or operator definitions could potentially be adapted or reused, saving development time.
                                                   * ServeGen Methodology & Code (upon release): The workload characterization methodology and per-client generation framework from ServeGen are critical for realistic workload inputs.1 If ServeGen is open-sourced as planned 85, its components for statistical modeling or client composition could be directly integrated or adapted.
                                                   * BurstGPT Dataset & Tools: The BurstGPT traces provide invaluable real-world data for parameterizing workload distributions and validating the generator.3 The associated BurstGPT-Perf tools might offer useful components, like the prompt pool or concurrency generation logic, that can be adapted.4
                                                   * Python Scientific Stack: Libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations, SciPy for statistical functions and distributions (e.g., scipy.stats.gamma.fit, scipy.stats.pareto.fit for parameter estimation from traces 7), and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis will be essential. Matplotlib or Seaborn can be used for visualization.
C. Calibration and Validation Considerations for the Simulator
While the simulator aims for hardware-agnostic comparison, its utility depends on the plausibility and relative correctness of its outputs.
                                                   * Iterative Calibration of Cost Models: The parametric cost models in the Virtual Hardware Modeler are central to performance estimation.
                                                   * Initial Parameters: Start with theoretical estimates (e.g., FLOP counts for GEMMs, byte counts for KV cache access based on model architecture).
                                                   * Relative Calibration: The key is not to perfectly match one specific piece of hardware but to ensure the relative costs of different operations (e.g., prefill vs. decode, GEMM vs. attention) and the scaling of these costs with batch size and sequence length are sensible. Publicly available benchmarks of real LLM serving frameworks on a few representative hardware types (e.g., an NVIDIA A100, H100) can serve as reference points. If Framework A is known to be 1.5x faster than Framework B on real hardware for a specific workload, the simulator (using an abstract virtual hardware profile that loosely corresponds to that hardware class) should ideally reproduce a similar relative difference. This can help tune the calibration factors or the coefficients in the cost model equations.
                                                   * No Cycle-Accuracy Goal: It must be emphasized that the goal is not to achieve cycle-accurate simulation of any particular physical GPU. The "virtual hardware" is an abstraction.
                                                   * Logical Validation of Framework Adapters:
                                                   * For each framework adapter, its internal logic must be validated against the documented behavior of the actual framework. For example:
                                                   * Does the vLLM adapter correctly implement PagedAttention's block allocation and deallocation, leading to expected (simulated) memory utilization patterns under varying sequence lengths?
                                                   * Does the TensorRT-LLM adapter correctly switch behavior between GUARANTEED_NO_EVICT and MAX_UTILIZATION policies regarding KV cache reservation and preemption?
                                                   * This can be done by instrumenting the adapter with detailed logging and running it with simple, controlled workloads to observe its decision-making process.
                                                   * Sensitivity Analysis:
                                                   * Systematically vary workload parameters (e.g., burstiness, average prompt length) and virtual hardware profile parameters (e.g., vGPU_memory_bandwidth_gbps, vGPU_compute_tflops_prefill_effective) to ensure the simulation results change in expected directions and magnitudes. For instance, increasing memory bandwidth should primarily benefit memory-bound decode operations.
                                                   * Comparison with Other Simulators (Conceptual):
                                                   * For very abstract and comparable scenarios (if definable), high-level outputs (like rank-ordering of simple policies) could be qualitatively compared against results from other simulators like TokenSim to identify any major, unexplained discrepancies in behavior.
A phased development approach is crucial for managing the complexity of building such a simulator. It allows for focused development and validation of individual components before integrating them into the larger system. This iterative process helps in identifying and rectifying design flaws or modeling inaccuracies early on, reducing the risk of compounding errors.
Furthermore, while the simulator is intended to be hardware-agnostic, anchoring its virtual performance space with a few well-understood reference points is beneficial. This does not mean forcing the simulator to replicate the absolute performance numbers of a specific GPU. Instead, it involves ensuring that the relative performance differences between frameworks, or the impact of changing a virtual hardware parameter (like doubling memory bandwidth), align qualitatively and, where possible, proportionally with trends observed in real-world systems or detailed academic studies. This grounding, even if approximate, significantly enhances the confidence in the simulator's comparative analyses and its utility for drawing meaningful conclusions about framework trade-offs.
VI. Conclusion and Future Outlook
The proposed virtual testing environment for LLM serving frameworks offers a powerful, cost-effective, and flexible platform for comparative performance analysis. By adopting a modular architecture based on discrete-event simulation, and by incorporating detailed models for realistic workload generation, LLM framework behavior, and parametric virtual hardware, this simulator can provide valuable insights into the complex interplay of factors that determine LLM serving performance. Its hardware-agnostic and framework-agnostic design ensures adaptability to the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, allowing users to easily swap and extend components to evaluate current and future serving solutions.
The key strengths of this designed simulator lie in its ability to:
                                                   1. Generate realistic and diverse LLM serving workloads, capturing critical characteristics like bursty arrivals, heterogeneous token length distributions, and conversational context, based on empirical findings from production systems.
                                                   2. Model the distinct operational logic of various LLM serving frameworks, including their unique approaches to batching (e.g., continuous, in-flight), KV cache management (e.g., PagedAttention, RadixAttention), scheduling policies, and architectural designs (e.g., disaggregated serving).
                                                   3. Simulate performance against abstract virtual hardware profiles, allowing users to explore the impact of different computational, memory, and interconnect capabilities without needing physical hardware.
                                                   4. Provide comprehensive performance metrics, including latency (TTFT, TPOT, end-to-end), throughput (RPS, TPS), queueing statistics, and simulated hardware utilization, enabling in-depth comparative analysis.
                                                   5. Offer an extensible platform, where new workload characteristics, LLM framework adapters, and virtual hardware models can be readily integrated.
The development and deployment of such a simulator can significantly aid researchers, ML engineers, and MLOps practitioners in making more informed decisions regarding the selection, configuration, and optimization of LLM serving infrastructure. It can help demystify the performance trade-offs between different solutions, identify potential bottlenecks under specific workload conditions, and guide the design of more efficient and scalable LLM deployment strategies.
Future Enhancements for this simulation environment could further increase its fidelity and scope:
                                                   * Advanced Network Modeling: Incorporating more detailed models for network topologies (e.g., fat-tree, Clos) and their impact on communication-intensive operations in distributed LLM serving, such as collective communications for tensor/pipeline parallelism or large KV cache transfers in disaggregated systems.
                                                   * Energy Consumption Modeling: Extending the virtual hardware profiles and cost models to include parameters related to power consumption. This would allow the simulator to estimate the energy efficiency of different framework and hardware configurations, a growing concern in large-scale AI deployments.
                                                   * AI-Driven Configuration Space Exploration: The number of possible configurations (workload x framework x virtual hardware x framework parameters) can be vast. Integrating AI techniques, such as reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization, could help automate the search for optimal or near-optimal serving configurations for specific performance objectives (e.g., minimizing latency under a throughput constraint).
                                                   * Support for Emerging LLM Architectures: As new LLM architectures like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) become more prevalent, the simulator could be extended to model their unique serving challenges, such as dynamic expert routing and load balancing across experts.
                                                   * Integration with Cost Modeling: Adding a layer to translate simulated resource consumption and performance into notional monetary costs, based on user-defined pricing for virtual resources, could provide direct insights into the economic implications of different deployment choices.
In conclusion, the creation of a robust, extensible, and hardware-agnostic LLM serving simulator represents a valuable contribution to the field. It promises to democratize the process of LLM serving performance analysis, foster deeper understanding, and ultimately contribute to the development of more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solutions for deploying the next generation of large language models.
Appendix for Advanced Network Modeling:
The network modeling will be a core component of the Parameterized Virtual Hardware Layer (Point 5d) and will be utilized by the Workload Generator (Point 5b) and the Pluggable LLM Framework Modules (Point 5c). Here's how it will be integrated:
                                                   1. Component: Parameterized Virtual Hardware Layer - Network Model
                                                   * Abstraction: The network will be modeled as a set of interconnected nodes (e.g., clients, load balancers, prefill workers, decode workers, GPU nodes). The level of detail in the topology can be configurable.
                                                   * Simple Model: Point-to-point links defined by latency (e.g., in microseconds or milliseconds) and bandwidth (e.g., in Gbps or GB/s) between key simulated entities. This can be represented as a matrix or a graph.
                                                   * Tiered Model: Abstract datacenter network tiers (e.g., intra-rack, inter-rack, inter-cluster) with different latency/bandwidth characteristics.
                                                   * Advanced (Optional): Basic support for common collective communication patterns if modeling tensor parallelism deeply (e.g., ring all-reduce cost based on link characteristics and data size).
                                                   * Parameters (User-Configurable):
                                                   * `link_latency_distribution`: (e.g., constant, uniform, normal) and its parameters for different link types.
                                                   * `link_bandwidth`: Maximum data transfer rate for different link types.
                                                   * `network_protocol_overhead_factor`: A small factor to account for protocol overhead if not modeling packets.
                                                   * `(Optional) topology_definition`: A way to define how nodes are connected if not using a simple fully-connected or pre-defined topology.
                                                   * Simulation using SimPy:
                                                   * Latency: Modeled as a `simpy.Timeout` event for the duration of the latency when a message transfer starts.
                                                   * Bandwidth & Contention: Each physical network link or path segment can be modeled as a `simpy.Resource(capacity=1)` if only one "message" can traverse at its full bandwidth, or more commonly, bandwidth itself is the consumable. A `simpy.Container(init=BANDWIDTH, capacity=BANDWIDTH)` could represent the available bandwidth per unit time on a link.
                                                   * To send data of `size_bytes` over a link with `bandwidth_bytes_per_sec`:
                                                   1. Request the link resource (if modeling serialization).
                                                   2. Simulate latency delay.
                                                   3. Calculate `transfer_time = size_bytes / bandwidth_bytes_per_sec`.
                                                   4. Hold a "bandwidth share" or the link resource for `transfer_time`. This means if other data transfers are competing for the same link, they will be queued by SimPy, naturally simulating contention.
                                                   * Alternative Bandwidth Model: A link resource (`simpy.Resource`) with capacity representing the number of parallel "flows" it can sustain without significant degradation, or a single resource where the service time is calculated based on `size`/`bandwidth`.
                                                   2. Component: Workload Generator - Network Interaction
                                                   * When a client request is generated, the workload generator will simulate the network path from the client to the entry point of the LLM serving system (e.g., load balancer or direct to framework).
                                                   * This involves:
                                                   * Looking up the network characteristics (latency, bandwidth) for the client-server link from the Virtual Hardware Layer.
                                                   * Simulating the time taken for the prompt (input tokens) to travel to the server, consuming network resources.
                                                   * Similarly, when tokens are streamed back to the client from an LLM framework model, the network path will be simulated for each token or chunk of tokens.
                                                   3. Component: Pluggable LLM Framework Modules - Network Interaction
                                                   * These modules must be aware of their own communication patterns, especially if they model distributed inference:
                                                   * Request Forwarding: If the framework involves a load balancer or router forwarding requests to backend model instances, these internal network hops (latency, bandwidth for request/response metadata and potentially small payloads) must be simulated.
                                                   * Tensor Parallelism:
                                                   * Simulate broadcast/all-reduce operations for forward/backward passes (though backward is less relevant for inference-only). This involves identifying data size (e.g., activations, weights) and the collective communication algorithm (e.g., ring, tree).
                                                   * The module would request appropriate inter-GPU/inter-node network links from the Virtual Hardware Layer and simulate the time taken.
                                                   * Pipeline Parallelism:
                                                   * Simulate the transfer of activations (and micro-batch data) between pipeline stages. Data size and link characteristics determine the bubble size.
                                                   * Disaggregated Architectures (e.g., Dynama-like, separate Prefill/Decode):
                                                   * KV Cache Transfer: This is critical. The model needs to estimate the size of the KV cache being transferred (based on sequence length, batch size, model config) from prefill workers to decode workers.
                                                   * It then requests the relevant network link(s) from the Virtual Hardware Layer and simulates the transfer time, including contention.
                                                   * Data Serialization/Deserialization: Optionally, small overheads for (de)serializing data before/after network transmission can be added.
