# GH200 Parallelization Strategy Comparison Summary

## Key Findings

### 1. Single GPU Limitations
- **Success Rate**: 0% (old sampling) to 2.7% (fixed sampling)
- **Issue**: Cannot handle large prompts (5,000-8,000 tokens) from heavy workload
- **Bottleneck**: Memory and compute constraints when processing large requests

### 2. Tensor Parallelism (TP=8)
- **Success Rate**: 100% (verified with 12,510 token requests)
- **Key Feature**: Chunked prefill implementation
  - Splits large prompts into 4,096 token chunks
  - Dynamically calculates max_batched_tokens (3,691 for TP=8)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Handles arbitrarily large prompts
  - Distributes compute across GPUs with AllReduce
  - Good for memory-bound workloads
- **Tradeoffs**: Communication overhead from collective operations

### 3. Data Parallelism (DP=8)
- **Success Rate**: 0.6% (without chunked prefill)
- **Issue**: Each instance still limited by single GPU constraints
- **Benefits**: 
  - Simple scaling for throughput
  - No communication overhead during inference
  - Good for many small requests
- **Limitations**: Doesn't help with large individual requests

### 4. Pipeline Parallelism (PP=8)
- **Status**: Not tested due to simulation time constraints
- **Expected Benefits**:
  - Memory distribution across pipeline stages
  - Each stage handles subset of layers
  - Good for very large models
- **Expected Tradeoffs**: 
  - Pipeline bubble overhead
  - Increased latency from sequential processing

### 5. Hybrid Approaches
- **TP=4, PP=2**: Balance compute distribution and memory sharding
- **TP=2, DP=4**: Combine request handling capacity with some large prompt support
- **TP=2, PP=2, DP=2**: Maximum flexibility but complex coordination

## Recommendations

1. **For Large Prompts (5,000+ tokens)**: Use TP=8 with chunked prefill
2. **For High Throughput**: Use DP=8 if individual requests are small
3. **For Balanced Workloads**: Consider hybrid approaches like TP=4,PP=2

## Implementation Details

### Chunked Prefill Configuration
```yaml
enable_chunked_prefill: true
prefill_chunk_size: 4096
# max_batched_tokens: dynamically calculated based on hardware
```

### Dynamic Batch Size Calculation
- Based on memory bandwidth, compute capacity, and communication overhead
- For GH200 with TP=8: 3,691 tokens per batch
- Ensures no deadlock from oversized requests

### Fixed LogNormal Sampling
- Corrected implementation now generates realistic prompt sizes
- Mean=8.7, sigma=0.17 produces ~6,000 token prompts on average
- Some prompts exceed 10,000 tokens, requiring chunked prefill

## Future Work

1. Complete full 5-minute simulations with all parallelization strategies
2. Test with different model sizes (not just Llama3-70B)
3. Implement adaptive scheduling based on request characteristics
4. Add support for speculative decoding and other optimizations
